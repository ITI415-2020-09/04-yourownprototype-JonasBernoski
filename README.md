# OwnPrototype
 
The design was based on the genre of first person shooters. I had the idea after comparing the slingshot and roll-a-ball builds and thought I could do something similiar
Sadly, I was unable to work on a camera that worked well while rotating and so settle for a run and gun sort of game style.
